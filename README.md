# Delta-V-calculator--windows-forms-
This is a windows forms delta V and orbital velocity calculator
User inputs apoapse and peryapse of orbit and chooses mode - orbital velocity or delta v - primary body - Earth, Moon or Sun.
Cressing calculate will display either orbital velocity of object on chosen orbit or delta v and injection into circular orbit.
