# Delta-V-calculator--windows-forms-
This is a windows forms delta V and orbital velocity calculator
User inputs apoapse and peryapse of orbit and chooses mode - orbital velocity or delta v - primary body - Earth, Moon or Sun.
Peryapse - point in orbit most distanced from the center of mass of primary body.
Apoapse - point in orbit closest to the center of mass of primary body.
Calculation radius - point in orbit where you want to make a calculation of orbital velocity. Can't be lower than peryapse, can't be higher than apoapse.
Final radius - in delta v calculation is new peryapse or apoapse after injection.
Injection into circular orbit - delta v required to turn elliptical orbit into circular.
Pressing calculate will display either orbital velocity of object on chosen orbit or delta v and injection into circular orbit.

Calculating even if orbit is below 0. Not a bug it's a feature.
